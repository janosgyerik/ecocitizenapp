migration to new architecture step by step
	improve logplayer self-disconnect
		either Logplayer should call disconnect logplayer as a service call
		or implement a new message, SENSORCONNECTION_DISCONNECTSELF
	UploaderService
		fix timezone
		test well
		activate in DeviceManagerClient
	fix BluetoothSensorService, make it a child of SensorManager
	automatic bt detection and proper handling in DeviceManagerClient
		if no bt, use logplayer instead
		otherwise use bt
		possibly option to use logplayer too
	clean up DeviceManagerClient (lots of commented out unused code)
	FileSaverService
		IMPORTANT
	rename non-services
		BluetoothSensorService -> BluetoothSensorManager
		LogplayerService -> LogplayerSensorManager

redmine
	use NotificationManager in DeviceManagerService
		add some icon dm_on when the service is running
		remove icon when the service is not running
		change icon to dm_connected when any devices are connected
	show latlon on tabular view activities as the top 2 rows

sensormap
	/login/username/token
	/startsession/.* for handling bad requests

optimization
	make logplayer device name the sample filename (asset name)
	comments in new source code, especially service code
	improve button style by using different style parent? theme?
	fix licence message

confirm with real android device
	can start and stop bt connections

tasks when connected to internet
	migrate tasks from launchpad to redmine

implement new architecture
	add SentenceConsumer interface, make the activity implement it
	add SentenceProvider interface, hook up to the activity

next
	fix session management
		consumer should receive device connect/disconnect messages
		on connect: startsession
		on sentence: store
		on disconnect: endsession
		application should also notify, and trigger endsession

core functionality
	add status indicator of data uploading
	add status indicator of incoming sensor data (already in Redmine)

optimization
	simulator
		when the sample file is finished, shutdown the service
		make connect/disconnect work
	tree page
		add battery level, aligned to the right on the same line as lat
		add nice colored scale for co2 level

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
