core: functionality
	automaticaly try to connect to last senspod
	add a blinking dot or something every time a message is received from the senspod, in case the values don't change for a long time, making the app look as if frozen

networking
	collect measurements in a queue
		submit when connected, in batches of N
		define cap, stop storing when full
	detect when internet is available, start/stop queue processing
	add queue state indicator on tree page: # of messages in queue

optimization
	simulator
		when the sample file is finished, shutdown the service
		make connect/disconnect work
	tree page
		add battery level, aligned to the right on the same line as lat
		add connect button on tree (home) page when disconnected
		add nice colored scale for co2 level

utility package for stratifying data
	can convert a numeric value to "level" indicator using various schemes
		linear
		exponential
		custom ranged

bugs
	bt scan shows two macbooks with the same mac address
	connect to paired senspod appears to succeed even when senspod is off
	shows 'connection lost' error when disconnect is triggered (it should disconnect quietly)
