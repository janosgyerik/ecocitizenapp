nice to have
	know the number of data records pending for upload
	user profiles: anon, dev, janos, ...

next
	how to build and deploy from the command line
	uploader should reload config if ...
	some bug after logfile finished...
		disconnectself sent repeatedly
		the service also crashes
	new variable in props.xml : override prefs (useful for debug)
	if SensorMap status is ok but login fails
		show error message
		button to open preferences and change settings
		button for SensorMapUploaderService.reloadConfig
		a proper activity for upload manager would be the best
		in the most primitive case: reload config on login failure
	FileSaverService
		IMPORTANT

optimization
	review comments in entire code, especially service code
	improve button style by using different style parent? theme?

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
