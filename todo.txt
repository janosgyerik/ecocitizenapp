when connected
	record some sample data file with zephyr
	get a copy of the zephyr docs

new release
	screenshots
		tree page with different colors
		main menu
		tabular+
		settings
		file uploader
		sentences ascii
		sentences hexa
	sensor map
		merge Masafumi's changes, review, commit, release
	release notes:
- Tabular view shows more GPS details (speed, altitude, accuracy, bearing)
- Cleaned up screens, removed unnecessary screens
- File uploader tool with preview function and delete option
- Hexadecimal view for binary data
- Reorganized settings screen with more options and Reset button
- Several other internal bugfixes

release in marketplace
	add a property to switch debugging on/off
	
tokyo marathon
	release in marketplace
	add support for zephyr

critical
	bug: shows connected to sensor even though it's not.... hard to reproduce!!!

next
	clean up files on android
		check on sessions that crash the app
		remove workaround code
	!! support for multiple devices at the same time
	! implement commenting
		override onSaveInstanceState method to prevent losing text when another application (like a phone call) comes to the foreground
	fix hardcoded values in debugtools
	bug: sending mock GPS sometimes does not work
	bug: sending mock GPS sometimes works even if AVD has no GPS support
	bug: username etc not updated in SettingsActivity after reset
		probably implementing OnSharedPrefsChanged might do the trick
	? bug: android uploader gets killed
	? bug: java.net.UnknownHostException

optimization
	if and only if performance is crucial, follow the 'Designing for Performance' article in Dev Guide
	try to rewrite nested linearlayouts with relativelayout
	consider using ViewStubs
	review comments in entire code, especially service code
	improve button style by using different style parent? theme?

file uploader "nice" implementation
	+ show file info card with buttons
	+ Upload btn begins upload in async mode
	- Cancel btn can interrupt the upload
	- progress bar is updated regularly
	- Close button cancels upload
	+ show success/failure on completion
	+ show/hide buttons on success/failure appropriately

minor improvements
	fileuploader: nicer progress indicator: full screen, modal + cancel
	fileuploader: progress indicator while uploading single file

nice to have
	tweet current location and measurements
	know the number of data records pending for upload
	user profiles: anon, dev, janos, ...
	FileSaverService with proper synchronization

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
