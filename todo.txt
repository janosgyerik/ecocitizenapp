when connected
==============
- record some sample data file with zephyr
- get a copy of the zephyr docs
	- confirm the protocol details (basically the language of Zephyr)


release in marketplace
======================
- add a property to switch debugging on/off - perhaps in props.xml?
- complete support for zephyr
- follow through the steps in android docs


current focus
=============
- bug: disconnect sensor and endsession seem be sent twice to logplayer. After the fix, also clean up endSession implementation in FileSaverService
- DeviceListActivity improvement
	- rename 'dummy devices' to something better
	- make dummy device items as wide as bt ones, with two lines
	- give descriptive names to logfile resources
	- show dummy devices only in 'Expert mode'
- ??: it seems two GpsLocationListeners are created, why?
- test cases
	- sensor connection
		- connect to device
		- the right messages received
		- new session log file opened
	- comment
		- subscribe to callbacks
		- start fake gps
		- send comment
		- comment received with gps
		- + simulate no gps
		- + similate no start gps
- bugfix: replace BundleTools with SentenceBundle
- redmine: AddNote activity: override onSaveInstanceState method to prevent losing text when another application (like a phone call) comes to the foreground
- redmine: configuration reloading issue
- redmine: add preferences option to enable 'Expert mode'
	- in DeviceListActivity show dummy devices only in Expert mode
- clean up variable visibility in .app
- add class diagram for .app
- add class diagrams to wiki with additional explanatory text


clean up the navigation and the menus
=====================================
- add small connect and disconnect buttons on data view screens
	treeview
	multisensor view
	debug tools
- make the menu uniform across data view screens
	treeview
	multisensor view
	debug tools
- remove connect and disconnect buttons from the menu
- bug: proper handling for title and custom title in all derived classes of DeviceManagerClient 
	what are ViewStubs and can they help here?
- bug: connected device names should be loaded when connecting to device manager
	- may be good to be tolerant to disconnect of unknown devices


support for multiple devices
============================
- when clicking disconnect sensor
	- if there is only one connected sensor, disconnect it
	- if there are many connected sensors 
		pop up a dialog and ask which one to disconnect
		option to disconnect all


support for zephyr
==================
- record some sample binary data from zephyr
- analyze the data and the protocol docs, figure out how to formulate sentences
- create the framework of appropriate drivers to use in bluetooth readers


critical for next experiment
============================
- bug: app gets into strange state after connection lost, sending session id 'null'
- improve data uploading throughput
	test slowness, confirm and quantify
	pack multiple messages in one transmission
	repeat test, confirm improvement
	automatically adjust sending buffer size
	! an alternative solution is to use an alternative high speed uploader class


next
====
- bug to redmine: username etc not updated in SettingsActivity after reset
	probably implementing OnSharedPrefsChanged might do the trick
- make it possible to cancel upload in FileInfoWithUploadActivity
	tip: the activity is launched from FileUploaderActivity
	tip: make ProgressDialog cancelable
- add progress bar while uploading a file in FileInfoWithUploadActivity
	tip: AsyncTask.onProgressUpdate
	since we know number of lines, this should be possible
- create the foundation for detecting sensor types and using different drivers based on sensor type
	use ascii reader with senspods
	use binary reader (zephyr reader) with zephyr
	apply unit type overrides (ppm instead of V for COx from senspods)
- clean up files on android
	check on sessions that crash the app
	remove workaround code
- fix hardcoded values in debugtools
? bug: android uploader gets killed
? bug: java.net.UnknownHostException


optimization
============
- use sensor id instead of name in DeviceManagerService
- if and only if performance is crucial, follow the 'Designing for Performance' article in Dev Guide
- try to rewrite nested linearlayouts with relativelayout
- consider using ViewStubs
- review comments in entire code, especially service code
- improve button style by using different style parent? theme?


file uploader "nice" implementation
===================================
+ show file info card with buttons
+ Upload btn begins upload in async mode
- Cancel btn can interrupt the upload
- progress bar is updated regularly
- Close button cancels upload
+ show success/failure on completion
+ show/hide buttons on success/failure appropriately


minor improvements
==================
- fileuploader: nicer progress indicator: full screen, modal + cancel
- fileuploader: progress indicator while uploading single file


nice to have
============
- tweet current location and measurements
- know the number of data records pending for upload
- user profiles: anon, dev, janos, ...
- FileSaverService with proper synchronization


possibly bluetooth backport bugs
================================
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
