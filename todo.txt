tasks when connected to internet
	register more tasks in launchpad

core: functionality
	automaticaly try to connect to last senspod
	add a blinking dot or something every time a message is received from the senspod, in case the values don't change for a long time, making the app look as if frozen

send data to server
	put server name and details in properties file
	if server is not reachable, fail silently
	update status bar when data sending succeeded or failed
	send both AndroidGPS and GPRMC

cache data while disconnected
	collect measurements in a queue
		submit when connected, in batches of N (or 1-by-1 at first)
	detect when internet is available, start/stop queue processing
	add queue state indicator on tree page: # of messages in queue

optimization
	send Sentence only in debug mode
		add new method to BluetoothSensorService to toggle
	simulator
		when the sample file is finished, shutdown the service
		make connect/disconnect work
	tree page
		add battery level, aligned to the right on the same line as lat
		add connect button on tree (home) page when disconnected
		add nice colored scale for co2 level

utility package for stratifying data
	can convert a numeric value to "level" indicator using various schemes
		linear
		exponential
		custom ranged

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is out of range or off
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
