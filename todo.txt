migration to new architecture step by step
	fix BluetoothSensorService, make it a child of SensorManager
	if SensorMap status is ok but login fails
		show error message
		button to open preferences and change settings
		button for SensorMapUploaderService.reloadConfig
		a proper activity for upload manager would be the best
		in the most primitive case: reload config on login failure
	FileSaverService
		IMPORTANT

redmine
	-

optimization
	make logplayer device name the sample filename (asset name)
	comments in new source code, especially service code
	improve button style by using different style parent? theme?
	fix licence message

confirm with real android device
	can start and stop bt connections

tasks when connected to internet
	migrate tasks from launchpad to redmine

implement new architecture
	add SentenceConsumer interface, make the activity implement it
	add SentenceProvider interface, hook up to the activity

next
	fix session management
		consumer should receive device connect/disconnect messages
		on connect: startsession
		on sentence: store
		on disconnect: endsession
		application should also notify, and trigger endsession

core functionality
	add status indicator of data uploading
	add status indicator of incoming sensor data (already in Redmine)

optimization
	simulator
		when the sample file is finished, shutdown the service
		make connect/disconnect work
	tree page
		add battery level, aligned to the right on the same line as lat
		add nice colored scale for co2 level

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
