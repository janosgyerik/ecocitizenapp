- implement crc check of Zephyr data


experiment good to have
=======================
- autoconnect
    - new activity to configure some paired devices for autoconnect
    - new button to connect to autoconnect devices
- automatically pair with sensors
- beta-release on marketpace (see below)


beta-release in marketplace
===========================
- remove the tree images
- create branch for new API version
- install on motorola
- create Android marketplace page
    - make it clear this is beta
- release on marketplace

R? about page in the app
R+ user registration activity
	- requires HttpUtil
	- username
	- password
	- get api key - HttpUtil
	- started from settings activity
		- also anon mode option
	- upload app reminds
		- if not logged in
		- if in anon mode
- rewrite SensorMapUploaderService to use HttpUtil
- create documentation (see section below)
- upload new apk to marketplace
- update info on marketplace
- announce the release
	- project blog
	- twitter
	- launchpad


tasks
=====
- use binary reader by default
    - designate a new bundle type for binary data
- hexa mode should signal to the service to use a binary reader
- do not duplicate the button definitions in the main activities but make them share code somehow
- add map tab, it probably still works somewhat even without the map tiles
- eliminate duplication of sensor id and name in bundles passed around
R create "red" style for buttons
- performance issues? consider the Dev Guide: 'Designing for Performance'


bugs
====
! bug: app gets into strange state after connection lost, sending session id 'null'
- bug: wrong pin is quietly ignored when pairing. NOT good!
- bug: filemanager.sh is not friendly
	- should show error if permission is denied (no sdcard)
	- what happens when usb debugging not enabled?
- bug: it seems two GpsLocationListeners are created, why?
- bug: why is this:
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 13 CO2Sample2.txt
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 15 null
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 13 CO2Sample2.txt
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 15 null
- bug: after entering comment, the keyboard lingers too long and the tree in the tree view looks squeezed and ugly


documentation
=============
- document adding drivers for new sensors: SensorDataParser
- update class diagram for .service
- add class diagram for .app
- add class diagrams to wiki with additional explanatory text


optimization
============
- clean up variable visibility in .app


obscure bugs
============
? bug: android uploader gets killed
? bug: java.net.UnknownHostException


possibly bluetooth backport bugs
================================
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
