when connected
	record some sample data file with zephyr
	get a copy of the zephyr docs

release in marketplace
	add a property to switch debugging on/off
	
when have android
	make sure BluetoothSensorManager still works...

critical
	but: connect to non-existent bt sensor works but it shouldn't
		disconnect from non-existent bt sensor does nothing
	use sensor id instead of name in DeviceManagerService
	critical bug: pairing no longer works from inside the app due to thread
		the thread never returns until pairing is properly finished
		and the app appears hung
		device disconnect is also not detected, worse than before
	design the steps to change the screens and create tasks in redmine
	design the steps to make it work with zephyr and create tasks in redmine
	create system diagram and upload to wiki
	change connectLogplayer to return bool
	change connectBluetoothDevice to return bool
	clean up messages coming from DeviceManagerService
		sensor connection is handled with connect* returning bool
		additional error messages are returned as text messages
		disconnect and sensor errors are returned as messages
		the change will affect both client and server sides
	bug: several bugs in debugtools
		connect to sensor button should not be shown when connected
		disconnect device menu does not work
	bug: scan for bt devices layout is completely broken
		and on first scan device names come up as null
		-> add to kit instructions: pair devices before starting the app
	bug: app gets into strange state after connection lost, sending session id 'null'
	bug: shows connected to sensor even though it's not.... hard to reproduce!!!
	improve data uploading throughput
		test slowness, confirm and quantify
		pack multiple messages in one transmission
		repeat test, confirm improvement
		automatically adjust sending buffer size


next
	create the foundation for detecting sensor types and using different drivers based on sensor type
		use ascii reader with senspods
		use binary reader (zephyr reader) with zephyr
		apply unit type overrides (ppm instead of V for COx from senspods)
	add support for zephyr
	clean up files on android
		check on sessions that crash the app
		remove workaround code
	!! support for multiple devices at the same time
		add to menu 'connect another'
	! implement commenting
		override onSaveInstanceState method to prevent losing text when another application (like a phone call) comes to the foreground
	fix hardcoded values in debugtools
	bug: sending mock GPS sometimes does not work
	bug: sending mock GPS sometimes works even if AVD has no GPS support
	bug: username etc not updated in SettingsActivity after reset
		probably implementing OnSharedPrefsChanged might do the trick
	? bug: android uploader gets killed
	? bug: java.net.UnknownHostException

optimization
	if and only if performance is crucial, follow the 'Designing for Performance' article in Dev Guide
	try to rewrite nested linearlayouts with relativelayout
	consider using ViewStubs
	review comments in entire code, especially service code
	improve button style by using different style parent? theme?

file uploader "nice" implementation
	+ show file info card with buttons
	+ Upload btn begins upload in async mode
	- Cancel btn can interrupt the upload
	- progress bar is updated regularly
	- Close button cancels upload
	+ show success/failure on completion
	+ show/hide buttons on success/failure appropriately

minor improvements
	fileuploader: nicer progress indicator: full screen, modal + cancel
	fileuploader: progress indicator while uploading single file

nice to have
	tweet current location and measurements
	know the number of data records pending for upload
	user profiles: anon, dev, janos, ...
	FileSaverService with proper synchronization

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
