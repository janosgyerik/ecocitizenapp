migration to new architecture step by step
	build gps provider into DM
	fix tree page
		connect/disconnect button
		show co2 value
		show lat/lon
	code cleansing
		variable names
		hardcoded strings
		icons
	TreeActivity = SenspodApp
		automatically connect to the service
		show connect button if service has no devices
	FileSaverService
		CRITICAL
	UploaderService
		CRITICAL

maybe for part-timers
	logplayer is robust
		automatically disconnects after file is finished
		start stop works consistently without errors

optimization
	remove all hardcoded strings from src/ and res/
		SentencesActivity
	automatically start service when app is started
	comments in new source code
	improve button style by using different style parent?
	implement Logplayer as an independent class, not as subclass of BT
		in the future we might create a unified interface for device manager to make it possible to connect any type of device. For now it's an unnecessary complication
	fix licence message

confirm with real android device
	can start and stop bt connections

tasks when connected to internet
	migrate tasks from launchpad to redmine

implement new architecture
	add SentenceConsumer interface, make the activity implement it
	add SentenceProvider interface, hook up to the activity

next
	fix session management
		consumer should receive device connect/disconnect messages
		on connect: startsession
		on sentence: store
		on disconnect: endsession
		application should also notify, and trigger endsession

core functionality
	add status indicator of data uploading
	add status indicator of incoming sensor data (already in Redmine)

optimization
	simulator
		when the sample file is finished, shutdown the service
		make connect/disconnect work
	tree page
		add battery level, aligned to the right on the same line as lat
		add nice colored scale for co2 level

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
