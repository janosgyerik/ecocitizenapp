core: functionality
	implement serialize/deserialize to send objects instead of messages
	collect measurements in a queue
		submit when connected, in batches of N
		define cap, stop storing when full
	detect when internet is available, start/stop queue processing

core: optimization
	when the sample file is finished, shutdown the service
	make connect/disconnect work with simulator
	clean up Format_*
	generate a UUID for BluetoothSensorService using any generator software

menu
	add a method that should be called after successful connect/disconnect,
	and make it update the menu accordingly (hide/show connect/disconnect)

tree page
	add connect button on tree (home) page when disconnected
	add nice colored scale for co2 level

utility package for stratifying data
	can convert a numeric value to "level" indicator using various schemes
		linear
		exponential
		custom ranged

bugs
	bt scan shows two macbooks with the same mac address
	connect to paired senspod appears to succeed even though senspod is off
	shows 'connection lost' error when disconnect is triggered (it should disconnect quietly)
