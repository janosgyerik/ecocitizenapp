release notes
=============
+ Easier navigation
	- Connect button on screen instead of menu
	- Tabs to switch easier between views
+ Data units are fixed on MultiSensorView
? improved icons and buttons


release in marketplace
======================
- remove debug tools from menu
- create branch for new API version
- install on motorola
- create Abdroid marketplace page
- release on marketplace
- announce the release
	- project blog
	- twitter
	- launchpad


current focus
=============
- add application icon
- add support for the other Zephyr device
- about page in the app with user registration info
- install improved icons
	- tab: tree
	- tab: graph
	- menu: disconnect
	- menu: upload
	? menu: settings
	? menu: quit
- login to website or use default (anon) API key
R make the tree not squeezed
- AddNote activity: override onSaveInstanceState method to prevent losing text when another application (like a phone call) comes to the foreground
- performance issues? consider the Dev Guide: 'Designing for Performance'
- review comments in entire code, especially service code
- bug: wrong pin is quietly ignored when pairing. NOT good!
- bug: filemanager.sh is not friendly
	- should show help when no args were entered
	- should show error if permission is denied (no sdcard)
	- what happens when usb debugging not enabled?
- redmine: make it possible to cancel file upload
- create common SensorDataParser interface and implementations
	- document adding drivers for new sensors
	- new release on project website
- add a zephyr logfile for testing purposes
- clean up MultiSensorView
- design new dedicated screen for zephyr -> Vika
- rename all 'sentence' related things to 'SensorData', where applicable
	- rename sendSentenceLineMsg to sendSensorDataMsg
	- rename getSentenceLine to getSensorData
	- rename SentenceBundleWrapper to SensorDataBundleWrapper
	- grep -ri sentence .
- bug: it seems two GpsLocationListeners are created, why?
- bug: why is this:
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 13 CO2Sample2.txt
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 15 null
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 13 CO2Sample2.txt
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 15 null
- clean up variable visibility in .app
- add class diagram for .app
- update class diagram for .service
- add class diagrams to wiki with additional explanatory text
- bug: after entering comment, the keyboard lingers too long and the tree in the tree view looks squeezed and ugly
- add disconnect all server method
- fix hardcoded values in debugtools
- file uploader: Cancel btn can interrupt the upload
	tip: the activity is launched from FileUploaderActivity
	tip: make ProgressDialog cancelable
- file uploader: progress bar is updated regularly
	tip: AsyncTask.onProgressUpdate
	since we know number of lines, this should be possible
- file uploader: Close button cancels upload
- file uploader: know the number of data records pending for upload
- FileSaverService with proper synchronization


critical for next experiment
============================
- bug: app gets into strange state after connection lost, sending session id 'null'
- improve data uploading throughput
	test slowness, confirm and quantify
	pack multiple messages in one transmission
	repeat test, confirm improvement
	automatically adjust sending buffer size
	! an alternative solution is to use an alternative high speed uploader class


obscure bugs
============
? bug: android uploader gets killed
? bug: java.net.UnknownHostException


nice to have
============
- consider using ViewStubs
- try to rewrite nested linearlayouts with relativelayout


possibly bluetooth backport bugs
================================
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
