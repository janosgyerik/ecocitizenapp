=============
+ Easier navigation
	- Connect button on screen instead of menu
	- Tabs to switch easier between views
+ Data units are fixed on MultiSensorView
? improved icons and buttons


release in marketplace
======================
- remove debug tools from menu
- create branch for new API version
- install on motorola
- create Abdroid marketplace page
- release on marketplace
- announce the release
	- project blog
	- twitter
	- launchpad


current focus
=============
R make the tree not squeezed
R implement FileUploader.cancel
V install improved icons
	- tab: tree
	- tab: graph
	? menu: disconnect
	- menu: upload
	? menu: settings
	? menu: quit
V design new dedicated screen for zephyr health sensors
! add support for the other Zephyr device
- add a zephyr logfile for testing/debugging purposes
- about page in the app with user registration info
- login to website or use default (anon) API key
- performance issues? consider the Dev Guide: 'Designing for Performance'
- review comments in entire code, especially service code
- improve data uploading throughput
	test slowness, confirm and quantify
	pack multiple messages in one transmission
	repeat test, confirm improvement
- file uploader: progress bar is updated regularly
	tip: AsyncTask.onProgressUpdate
	since we know number of lines, this should be possible


bugs
====
! bug: app gets into strange state after connection lost, sending session id 'null'
- bug: wrong pin is quietly ignored when pairing. NOT good!
- bug: filemanager.sh is not friendly
	- should show help when no args were entered
	- should show error if permission is denied (no sdcard)
	- what happens when usb debugging not enabled?
- bug: it seems two GpsLocationListeners are created, why?
- bug: why is this:
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 13 CO2Sample2.txt
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 15 null
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 13 CO2Sample2.txt
    D/DeviceManagerClient( 2764): handleMessage 15 null
- bug: after entering comment, the keyboard lingers too long and the tree in the tree view looks squeezed and ugly


documentation
=============
- document adding drivers for new sensors: SensorDataParser
- update class diagram for .service
- add class diagram for .app
- add class diagrams to wiki with additional explanatory text


optimization
============
- clean up variable visibility in .app


obscure bugs
============
? bug: android uploader gets killed
? bug: java.net.UnknownHostException


nice to have
============
- consider using ViewStubs
- try to rewrite nested linearlayouts with relativelayout


possibly bluetooth backport bugs
================================
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
