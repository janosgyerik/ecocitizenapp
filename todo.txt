confirm with real android device
	API v3 works
	test if Android times are indeed UTC
		use the commented out sample code in CitySenspod.java
	sending more AndroidGps details works

blocker: best practice of android apps with multiple screens

tasks when connected to internet
	migrate tasks from launchpad to redmine
	add to the wiki about emulator slowness and eclipse tips

IMPORTANT: test message uploader queue with handler
	how to check the number of pending messages on the handler's queue
		-> compare a counter in the sender and the handler
	implement uploader using handler
	prepare receiver website (localhost), but do not start
	start simulator, observe messages sent to queue but not sent to web
		track messages with seq id
	start web server
	observe all messages getting sent from first seq id

implement new architecture
	add SentenceConsumer interface, make the activity implement it
	add SentenceProvider interface, hook up to the activity

next
	grep -i todo in src/
	fix session management
		consumer should receive device connect/disconnect messages
		on connect: startsession
		on sentence: store
		on disconnect: endsession
		application should also notify, and trigger endsession

core functionality
	add status indicator of data uploading
	add status indicator of incoming sensor data (already in Redmine)

optimization
	simulator
		when the sample file is finished, shutdown the service
		make connect/disconnect work
	tree page
		add battery level, aligned to the right on the same line as lat
		add connect button on tree (home) page when disconnected
		add nice colored scale for co2 level

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
