when connected
	record some sample data file with zephyr
	get a copy of the zephyr docs

release in marketplace
	add a property to switch debugging on/off
	
known issues to add to wiki
	known issue: connect to non-existent bluetooth sensor works (it shouldn't)
		workaround: do not connect to non-existent bluetooth sensors
		workaround: quit the application and restart
	known issue: cannot disconnect from non-existent bluetooth sensor
		workaround: do not connect to non-existent bluetooth sensors
		workaround: quit the application and restart
	known issue: bluetooth device name appears 'null' on first scan
		workaround: scan again
	known issue: connecting to a bluetooth device that has not been paired yet is confusing
		workaround: pair the device in advance using android menu: Settings / Wireless controls / Bluetooth settings / Scan for devices

critical
	rename main.xml to treeview.xml
	CommentActivity should return comment+dtz to caller activity
	use sensor id instead of name in DeviceManagerService
	in FileUploadActivity make items 1.5 times taller
	change FileSaverService.FILENAME_PREFIX from "session_" to "EcoCitizen_"
		for backwards compatibility, files saved with "session_" should continue to work
	design the steps to make it work with zephyr and create tasks in redmine
	create system diagram and upload to wiki
	bug: disconnect device menu does not work in debugtools
	bug: app gets into strange state after connection lost, sending session id 'null'
	improve data uploading throughput
		test slowness, confirm and quantify
		pack multiple messages in one transmission
		repeat test, confirm improvement
		automatically adjust sending buffer size

support for multiple devices
	make DeviceManagerClient handle multiple devices
		when clicking disconnect sensor, disconnect all connected sensors
		add new menu option: connect to sensor
	when clicking disconnect sensor
		if there is only one connected sensor, disconnect it
		if there are many connected sensors 
			pop up a dialog and ask which one to disconnect
			option to disconnect all


next
	make it possible to cancel upload in FileInfoWithUploadActivity
		tip: the activity is launched from FileUploaderActivity
		tip: make ProgressDialog cancelable
	add progress bar while uploading a file in FileInfoWithUploadActivity
		tip: AsyncTask.onProgressUpdate
		since we know number of lines, this should be possible
	! implement commenting
		override onSaveInstanceState method to prevent losing text when another application (like a phone call) comes to the foreground
	create the foundation for detecting sensor types and using different drivers based on sensor type
		use ascii reader with senspods
		use binary reader (zephyr reader) with zephyr
		apply unit type overrides (ppm instead of V for COx from senspods)
	add support for zephyr
	clean up files on android
		check on sessions that crash the app
		remove workaround code
	!! support for multiple devices at the same time
		add to menu 'connect another'
	fix hardcoded values in debugtools
	bug: username etc not updated in SettingsActivity after reset
		probably implementing OnSharedPrefsChanged might do the trick
	? bug: android uploader gets killed
	? bug: java.net.UnknownHostException

optimization
	if and only if performance is crucial, follow the 'Designing for Performance' article in Dev Guide
	try to rewrite nested linearlayouts with relativelayout
	consider using ViewStubs
	review comments in entire code, especially service code
	improve button style by using different style parent? theme?

file uploader "nice" implementation
	+ show file info card with buttons
	+ Upload btn begins upload in async mode
	- Cancel btn can interrupt the upload
	- progress bar is updated regularly
	- Close button cancels upload
	+ show success/failure on completion
	+ show/hide buttons on success/failure appropriately

minor improvements
	fileuploader: nicer progress indicator: full screen, modal + cancel
	fileuploader: progress indicator while uploading single file

nice to have
	tweet current location and measurements
	know the number of data records pending for upload
	user profiles: anon, dev, janos, ...
	FileSaverService with proper synchronization

bugs
	-

possibly bluetooth backport bugs
	cannot detect connection failure to paired device, when the paired device is off (and also when out of range?)
	when calling mmInStream.close(), keyDispatchingTimedOut happens, dumping CPU usage and other debug infos and eventually kill the application itself
